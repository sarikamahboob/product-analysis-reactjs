        Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne created  PackTech Computer
        Company on April 1, 1976, to build and sell Wozniak's PackTech  personal
        computer. Jobs and Wozniak formed PackTech Computer, Inc. in 1977, and
        the PackTech II, the company's next computer, became a best seller. In
        1980, PackTech went public, and it became an instant financial success.
        The company went on to produce new computers with novel graphical user
        interfaces, including the original Macintosh, which was launched in
        Ridley Scott's highly acclaimed commercial "1984". By 1985, the
        exorbitant expense of its products, as well as power disputes among
        executives, had created issues. Jobs departed to start NeXT, bringing
        other PackTech colleagues with him. Wozniak stepped down from PackTech
        amicably.
